[AtomicTorch](https://atomictorch.com/) offers a tool to translate its [VoidExpanse](http://voidexpanse.com/) videogame (LocalizationUtility).

However, **LocalizationUtility has several drawbacks**.
Most notably, the program can crash at any time, causing all progress in translating the game to be lost.

Since the game language files are spread over several .TXT and XML files, one of the things the official program does is to handle all these files at the same time, which is, in my opinion, overly complicated technically.

I have created these tools to cover most of the LocalizationUtility functions and finally have all the language files in simple text files.

I created **VoidTranslator** as a more stable, faster and easier to use alternative to LocalizationUtility.

In short, everything you will need to translate the game to your language is in this repository.
To get all the base language files (English), you just need the "**data_en_us.zip**" file and extract it anywhere.

To translate the game, you just need "**VoidTranslator**" and select the folder with the language files.
